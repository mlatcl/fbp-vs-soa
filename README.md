This repo contains code for comparison flow-based programming (FBP) and software services (SOA) in the context of machine learning deployment.

This branch of the repository contains six implementations of Ride Allocation app, which allocates taxi drivers to incoming taxi ride requests. These implementations represent the same software at different stages of development using one of the aforementioned paradigms. Here is the complete list:

* [fbp_app_min](fbp_app_min/) - basic functionality implemented with FBP
* [fbp_app_data](fbp_app_data/) - same as above, plus dataset collection for wait time estimation
* [fbp_app_ml](fbp_app_ml/) - same as above, plus deployment of trained ML model that outputs estimated wait time for each allocated ride

* [soa_app_min](soa_app_min/) - basic functionality implemented with SOA
* [soa_app_data](soa_app_data/) - same as above, plus dataset collection for wait time estimation
* [soa_app_ml](soa_app_ml/) - same as above, plus deployment of trained ML model that outputs estimated wait time for each allocated ride

Other source files are used to define common data types and generate some input data.

### How to run the code

Entry point for running any of the applications is [main.py](main.py). To run a particular version of the app, run:

    python main.py <app_key>

for example for `fbp_app_ml`:

    python main.py fbp_app_ml

Note that SOA apps are implemented as Flask web services, and thus requires flask process to run to serve requests. Each SOA app has a `flaskr/README.md` file that explains how to do that.

### How to collect metrics

Run [code_metrics.sh](code_metrics.sh) can collect code metrics for all the apps. We collect several [Halstead metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures), [cyclomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) and [cognitive](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability) complexities, [maintainability index](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#maintainability-index).

To output metrics data in the console:

    ./code_metrics.sh

To write metrics data to a file in CSV format:

    ./code_metrics.sh <filename>

### Ride Allocation app
At the highest level our implementation consists of two parts: the allocation system itself and the code that simulates events happening in the outside world.

The allocation system provides several functions. First, it assigns taxi drivers to incoming ride requests. Second, it keeps track of all allocated rides and updates them according to the incoming events. We recognize several types of events: ride starts, ride finishes, location updates, cancellations. Third, it calculates factual wait times for passengers, defined as a difference between the moment a ride was allocated and the passengerâ€™s pickup.

The simulation part is implemented as a discrete-event simulation and is responsible for generating events that would be happening if our system was deployed as a part of a real life taxi application. In addition to creating initial data like a list of available drivers, it generates new ride requests and events for rides that were previously allocated.

MBlogger is heavily inspired by Kafker: https://github.com/mlatcl/kafker . In fact it is almost a complete port of Kafker to flowpipe.


To run any of the individual files go to the root folder of the package and do

```
python -m mblogger.<module>.app
```

for example

```
python -m mblogger.fbp_app_min.app
```

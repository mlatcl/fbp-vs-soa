Playllist Builder closely follows tutorial from Metaflow documentation: https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials . The idea is to build playlists of movies for a given genre, spiced up by random movies and by box office stats of each movie.

To run any of the individual files go to the root folder of the package and do

```
python -m playlist_builder.<module>.<app>
```

for example

```
python -m playlist_builder.fbp_app_min.fbp_app_min
```
